        <h3>Reasons I love it:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="b">It is so cozy! I love curling up on the couch to harvest some crops and pet my chickens. There is also a huge amount of variation in play styles - you can play completely chill and cozy, or you can set a goal for yourself to complete in a certain amount of in-game time.</li>
            <li class="b">The community! The Stardew Valley community is super supportive of new players and creates some of the best stuff. For examples, see:

            <li class="b">The developer! Stardew Valley has been around since 2016, and as of writing this (in February of 2023), ConcernedApe is still putting out patches for mobile versions of the game. ConcernedApe is obviously continuously committed to making the game better, and that is one of the most exciting parts about playing it.</li>
